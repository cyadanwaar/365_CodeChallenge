# This porblem is taken from leetcode in which we have to simplify a given path to canonical path which means that we have to convert the given path to unique path.
# The problem no = 71.Simplify Path

class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for directory in path.split('/'):
            if directory == '':
                pass
            elif directory == '.':
                pass
            elif directory == '..':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(directory)
        
        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
