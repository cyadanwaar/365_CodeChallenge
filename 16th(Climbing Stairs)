# This code is taken from leetcode in which we have to predict the distinct number of steps to reach the top.
# The problem no = 70. Climbing Stairs

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        n1,n2=1,2
        if n==1 or n==2:
            return n
        for i in range(2,n):
            n3=n1+n2
            n1,n2=n2,n3
        return n3
